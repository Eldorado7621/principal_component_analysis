# principal_component_analysis

Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique. In trying to reduce the dimension of datasets, it is essential to figure out the most essential sets of principal components that have the most impact on the target variable. Due to sparseness of data, the contribution of certain features to the classification task is close to nothing- hence, these features can be ignored. This is the whole idea behind PCA.

In this example, handwritten digits of dimension 64 (8*8 pixels) is reduced to 29 and the accuracy of the model is still preserved
